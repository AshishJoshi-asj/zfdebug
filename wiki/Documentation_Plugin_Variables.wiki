None

=== Contents in the menu tab ===
None

=== Contents in the content panel ===
  * Contents of $_COOKIE
  * Contents of $_POST, if http request type is POST
  * Detailed information about your request

=== How to use ===
This plugin is loaded if you do not change the plugin configuration, you do not
need any additional configuration.

With this plugin you can determine if, if any output is missing, its because of
the view script or if the controller did not assign that part.
