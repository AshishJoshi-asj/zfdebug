# ZFDebug - a debug bar for Zend Framework #
ZFDebug is a plugin for the Zend Framework for PHP5 written by Joakim Nyg√•rd. It provides useful debug information displayed in a small bar at the bottom of every page. ZF Debug has been renamed from **Scienta ZF Debug Bar** when moving from private hosting to googlecode. The original [page for Scienta ZF Debug Bar remains available](http://jokke.dk/software/scientadebugbar)

Time spent, memory usage and number of database queries are presented at a glance. Additionally, included files, a listing of available view variables and the complete SQL command of all queries are shown in separate panels (shown configured with 2 database adapters):
