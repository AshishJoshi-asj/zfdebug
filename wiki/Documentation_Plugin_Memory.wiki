None

=== How to use ===
The plugin itself looks very useless. But it will be very important when you are going to optimize you application, a same request should also need same memory. Compare the following code using the memory plugin

{{{
<?php
$object1 = new MyObject();
$object2 = new MyObject();
$object3 = new MyObject();
$object4 = new MyObject();
$object1->doSomething();
$object2->doSomething();
$object3->doSomething();
$object4->doSomething();
?>

<?php
$object = new MyObject();
$object->doSomething();
$object->doSomething();
$object->doSomething();
$object->doSomething();
?>
}}}

If you use Zend_Cache the memory plugin will allow you to see your cache enchancements.
